House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on certain features of the houses. Using historical data, we train the model and evaluate its performance to ensure it provides accurate predictions.

Datasets
We have two datasets for this project:

Training Dataset (train.csv): This dataset includes features of houses along with their sale prices. It will be used to train the linear regression model.
Test Dataset (test.csv): This dataset includes features of houses but does not include sale prices. The model will predict the sale prices for these houses.
Features
For this project, we focus on the following features:

GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above ground.
FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.
The target variable we aim to predict is:

SalePrice: The price at which the house was sold.
Steps Involved
1. Loading and Inspecting Data
Load the training and test datasets, and inspect the first few rows to understand the structure and identify the features and target variable.

2. Preprocessing Data
Handle missing values by dropping rows with missing values in the relevant columns to ensure the datasets are clean and ready for modeling.

3. Feature Selection
Select GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, and FullBath as the features for the model. Extract SalePrice as the target variable from the training dataset.

4. Training the Model
Split the training dataset into features (X_train) and target variable (y_train). Train a linear regression model using the training data.

5. Predicting and Evaluating
Use the trained model to predict house prices for the test dataset. Optionally, evaluate the model's performance on the training dataset to understand its accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

6. Prediction Output
Print the predicted house prices for the test dataset.

Conclusion
This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on a few key features. The process includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction. By following these steps, we develop a model that helps estimate house prices given certain attributes of the house. This can be useful for real estate analysis, pricing strategies, and investment decisions.
